# Moonshot

## Project 8

An app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program (by Paul Hudson - @twostraws).

## Paul's challenges resolution

In the end of the project, Paul laves three challenges for the student (which is what the branch `challenge` is all about):

1. Add the launch date to MissionView, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you.
2. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in MissionView is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the Rectangle dividers out too.
3. For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to ContentView that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.

You can see the final result in the animated gif below:
